# code
This code estimates the strength of an input password with the help of HTML. CSS and JavaScript.
The JavaScript file includes the implementation of Regular Expression in JavsScript to check the metrics required for a strong password. The password srtrength is calculated on a score basis which decides whether the password is weak, average or strong.
The JavaScript code is stored in an external Script file and integrated into the HTML file and hence, a webpage is made.
CSS is used to develop the layout of the webpage.
